From opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is appreciated and welcomed.
If you're planning a new feature or changing the api, please create an issue first.
This way we can ensure that your precious work is not in vain.

## Issues

In most cases if a bug is discovered, an issue may be raised, also based on the development lifecyle, issues can be selected from already raised ones. 

## Setup
For this project we make use of the laravel framework. In order to contribute code to this project,

**make sure your system(server) meets the following specifications;**

The server side code is build with the following technolologies....
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

Assumptions made here are
1. Node.js is installed   
   - version 8.x or greater
   - `v8.11.1 LTS (Current)` prefferable
   - Installation steps can be found here `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`

2. NPM is  installed
   - npm version 5.x or greater
   - 'v6.0.0' (Current) prefferable
   - Luckly for you npm intalls authomatically when intalling Node.js
   

## Naming a branch

Making a branch in your fork for your contribution is helpful in the following ways:
    
  - It allows you to submit more than one contribution in a single PR.
  - It allows us to identify what your contribution is about from the branch name.

You will want to checkout the master branch locally before creating your new branch.
